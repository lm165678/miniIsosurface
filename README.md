# miniIsosurface #

The miniIsosurface miniapp consists of Marching Cubes and Flying Edges
isosurface algorithms implemented on a variety of parallel computing
paradigms. For comparison purposes, there is also an equivalent program to
run the implementation in the VTK library.

  resolution 3D surface construction algorithm." ACM siggraph computer
  graphics. Vol. 21. No. 4. ACM, 1987.

The Flying Edges paper:
* Schroeder, William, Rob Maynard, and Berk Geveci. "Flying edges: A
  high-performance scalable isocontouring algorithm." Large Data Analysis
  and Visualization (LDAV), 2015 IEEE 5th Symposium on. IEEE, 2015.
